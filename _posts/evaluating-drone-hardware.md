# Evaluating Drone Hardware

Finding the right drone is not a trivial task. Our requirements were:

* moderate pricing (max. 1000 EUR)
* Open APIs 
* able to carry a Raspberry Pi
* able to integrate with OpenCV
* stable flight characteristics
* indoor usable (limited in size, speed, agility)


We discussed our needs with a drone building expert. The recommendations were:

* built your own drone
* a self made drone is better for understanding the basics, how a drone works
* a self made drone is more flexiable than a pre build, especially for spare parts
* the bebop is just for drone starters who want to fly around and make some nice photos/videos

We considered the following models:

* Parrot Bebop 2
* DJI Phantom 3
* self made racing drone on a 450 mm frame contolled by a CC3D chip
* self made drone based on the pixhawk controller

Finally we decided to buy:
* Parrot Bebop 2

Why did we choose it?
* within the budget
* sdk for contolling thr drone availiable
* good video quality
* stable in-room flights
* possibility to flash the firmware for controling the drone with the ardupilot software (if the offered sdk is not enought)

* Parrot Bebop 2
* full hd video camera
* up to 25 min air-time
* Pictures

## First Impressions

* easy controlling with the skymaster remote control
* very good flying qualities
* setting up limitations like maximum altitude or speed is very accurate 

* Video of drone flying (put on youtube, have some basic CI for the project)
* Video from drone camera flying through the office
